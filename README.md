Matthew DeLorenzo Hedera Hackathon 2024 submission: HTS1400

## Introduction

This repository creates a smart contract controlled Hedera Token Service (HTS) token compatible with the Ethereum security token standard ERC1400. ERC1400 is an umbrella standard encompassing ERC1410, ERC1594, ERC1643, and ERC1644. Its purpose is to enable the tokenization of real world assets (RWAs) on the Hedera network with the same specifications as common security token standards on the Ethereum network.

This repository has four main seconds:
